[Snipplr](http://snipplr.com) was designed to solve a simple problem. I had
too many random bits of code and HTML scattered all over my computer. I'd hunt
and dig around for five minutes looking for the couple lines of code I wrote
four projects ago just so I wouldn't have to retype them. I'm lazy. I needed a
way to keep all my stuff organized. Snipplr was my solution. Now, all of my
code snippets are stored in one place. Best of all, the other guys at work
have access to my code library and vice versa.

With Snipplr you can keep all of your frequently used code snippets in one
place that's accessible from any computer. You can share your code with other
visitors and use what they post, too.

Did I mention that Snipplr works with [TextMate](http://macromates.com)? Yeah,
it rocks.

If you'd like to know more about Snipplr or get an inside look at the
development process behind it, check out the [blog](http://snipplr.com/blog/).

In September 2006, Snipplr was sold to [Sitening](http://sitening.com). In 2010, Sitening sold Snipplr to some French dude on auction. A few months later, it was sold again to [Envato](http://envato.com/). I'm happy to report it's still in their capable hands.
