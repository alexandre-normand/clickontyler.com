Three years ago this week, [August 27th, 2007](http://clickontyler.com/blog/2007/08/say-hello-to-virtualhostx/) to be exact, I had my first sale of [VirtualHostX](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/). Amazingly, it was also the _first day_ I posted it online. (I still have no idea how that kind soul found it so fast.) Since then, VirtualHostX has gone through countless updates and one major revision. I've also launched three other Mac products and (sometime next week) my second iPhone app will make its way onto the App store.

In three short years, ten-thousand of you have thought highly enough of my work to hand over a little bit of your hard earned money. For that I am truly, truly grateful. While I've yet to make it "big", or even big enough to quit my day job, I'm getting closer. Nonetheless, your support has already had a major impact on my life. It helped finance [our first house](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tylerhall/390580705/), a cross-country move to be closer to family, and pay for repairs after we woke up [one morning](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEaS-9ACrYc) to find five feet of water in our basement.

My hope is that the next three years will be even more productive. In the coming weeks, I've got a slew of minor updates planned for VirtualHostX, Incoming!, and Nottingham. In September, I'm launching my largest project ever &mdash; a hosted web service designed to make Mac developer's lives a whole lot easier. (If you've been following along with this blog you can probably guess what it is.) After that, my plan is to complete work on VirtualHostX 3.0 in time for an end-of-the-year release.

So again, to everyone who's bought one of my apps, emailed with a question or a feature suggestion, or contributed code to one of my open-source projects, THANK YOU.
