In case you missed it, the [Simple PHP Framework](http://code.google.com/p/simple-php-framework/) hit its 1.0 milestone earlier this week. Nearly two years in the making, I'm happy to see a stable, downloadable package [available](http://code.google.com/p/simple-php-framework/downloads/list) for all our users to benefit from. Cheers to everyone who contributed!
