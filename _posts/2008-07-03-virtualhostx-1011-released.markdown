I released [VirtualHostX](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/) 1.0.11 this afternoon. In addition to fixing a bug where the DocumentRoot wasn't being remembered, this release is the first to include [OpenFeedback](http://clickontyler.com/appcaster/) &mdash; an open source Cocoa framework I published last month. This allows users to submit feedback (bug reports, feature requests, support questions) from inside VirtualHostX. It's much easier than visiting a website or composing an email. Just select "Send Feedback" from the main menu and OpenFeedback takes care of the rest. Here's a screenshot.
