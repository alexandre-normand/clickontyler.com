I've been tossing this idea around for a while now and decided last night to just go ahead and do it. VirtualHostX is now free for students. All you need is a .edu email address and [I'll send you a license](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/student/) free of charge.

### Um, why? ###

Good question. There's no master plan or secret motive behind giving away free licenses. I do it [all](http://twitter.com/vidluther/statuses/1187154708) [the](http://twitter.com/fuzzyness/statuses/1125058997) [time](http://twitter.com/patbrumfield/statuses/1220208930), [actually](http://twitter.com/anima/statuses/1198550825). I just think that students have enough expenses on their plate without needing to fork over a few bucks for an app that, more than likely, is only used in their spare time until they graduate.

I've been programming for a long time &mdash; since I was ten. I started out writing small programs in [GW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC) and [QBasic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic). When I was thirteen I mowed lawns and saved money until I could afford a copy of [Visual Basic 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic), but only because Microsoft offered an educational discount. I couldn't have afforded it otherwise.

Now I'm not saying that if it weren't for Microsoft and Visual Basic I wouldn't have become a developer, but it definitely made the the trip easier.

So that's what I'm trying to do here. If there are high school or college students just starting out in web development &mdash; maybe building small sites to help pay for books or beer &mdash; and VirtualHostX can help, that's awesome. It's the least I can do.
