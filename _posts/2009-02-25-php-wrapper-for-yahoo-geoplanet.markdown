Earlier this month I wrote a quick PHP wrapper for [Yahoo!'s GeoPlanet API](http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/). It's a super useful service for querying geographical information about nearly any place on earth &mdash; addresses, landmarks, colloquial locations, etc. Or, as the official description says

 > GeoPlanet helps bridge the gap between the real and virtual worlds by providing an open, permanent, and intelligent infrastructure for geo-referencing data on the Internet.

There were already Perl, Python, and Ruby wrappers. I figured I'd throw PHP into the mix.

[Pete Warden](http://petewarden.typepad.com/) has already written some [example code](http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2009/02/how-to-emulate-near-in-the-twitter-search-api-using-geoplanet.html) that uses the wrapper to emulate Twitter's nearby location search.

You can [download the source from GitHub](http://github.com/tylerhall/php-geoplanet/). As usual, it's licensed under the MIT License and free to use in any way you like.
