A lesson for all you iPhone owners out there: don't leave your phone on a
table that your dog can reach.

I got out of the shower this morning to find my dog, Gracie, gnawing away on
my phone in the middle of the living room. I was a little upset, but life goes
on. How'd the iPhone fare against the jaws of a [25-pound canine beast](http://flickr.com/photos/tylerhall/sets/72157600185173319/)? See for
yourself . . .

The bottom backside has a bunch of teeth marks in it. I can tell she was
really biting into it hard. The ringer/speaker is still alive - barely. Even
on full volume it's real quiet now. The screen protector took the most damage.
She bit holes right through a number of places, bent it back, and nearly had
it peeled off.

But the screen? The actual glass? Not a scratch on it. Wow.
