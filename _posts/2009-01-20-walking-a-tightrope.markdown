If you'll bear with me for a quick detour, I just wanted to post a link to <a href="http://highwireapp.com">http://highwireapp.com</a> &mdash; a new app for Mac OS X that I'm working on. I don't normally like to pre-announce projects, but this time I wanted to try something different and journal the development process publicly. You can read the introductory post <a href="http://highwireapp.com/2009/01/19/i-must-be-crazy/">here</a>.
