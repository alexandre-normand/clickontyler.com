In <img src="{{ site.cdn_url }}/blog/sparrowblogpic.png" style="float:right;" /> case you [missed it](http://twitter.com/fireeagle/status/1197766369), Sparrow, my [iPhone Fire Eagle updater](http://clickontyler.com/sparrow/), is now available for free on the App Store.

In addition to the much improved price, Sparrow now updates your Twitter profile with your _location name_ rather than your _coordinates_. So instead of something ugly like "37.321, -121.999", you'll get a much more attractive "1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA".

But what if you don't want your Twitter profile to show your exact address? Simple. Login to Fire Eagle and go to your [My Applications](http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/my/apps) section. From there, you can edit Sparrow's permissions and restrict it to your zip code, neighborhood, city, state, etc &mdash; whatever you feel comfortable sharing. It's a great example of how flexible and, more importantly, empowering Fire Eagle's security model is. It's a web service that really does put its users first.

### I'd Like to Thank the Academy... ###

Sparrow has gotten some great press in the past month. In an article about the privacy implications of Google's new Latitude service, [_Wired_](http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/02/gmails-new-add.html) called out Sparrow as among the best mobile Fire Eagle updaters. And [Programmable Web](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2009/02/13/yahoos-fire-eagle-powers-the-iphone-locator-app-sparrow/) chose Sparrow as their Mashup of the Day saying it's "a good example of how a few web APIs can be elegantly implemented for use on a mobile device."

So now that Sparrow is free, what are you waiting for? [Download](http://clickontyler.com/sparrow/itunes/) your copy today and go, go, Fire Eagle!
