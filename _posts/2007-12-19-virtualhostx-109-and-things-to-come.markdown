I just pushed out a new maintenance release of
[VirtualHostX](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/). Version 1.0.9 improves
support for Leopard and MAMP. I want to say thanks to all of the VHX users who
have been sending in feedback during the last month. You all were a great
help!

Barring any new bug reports, after the holidays I'm going to focus my efforts
on getting VirtualHostX 2.0 out the door. I've collected everyone's feedback
and come up with what (I think) is the final feature list. In addition to
adding more configuration options for each vhost, I've got a couple new
additions planned that will be a huge boon to small web development shops.
(I'm being purposely vague because I don't want to tip my hand just yet.)
Version 2.0 will be a free upgrade for registered users.

Happy holidays, everyone!
