I don't know how I ever missed this Apple Mail plugin, but you absolutely have to give [MsgFiler](http://www.tow.com/msgfiler/) a try if you're a heavy keyboard user. It lets you move messages into any folder in your mailbox using only the keyboard.

Press &#8984;9 to pull up a TextMate-like list of your mailbox folders. Then, select a folder by typing the first few letters in its name and move the currently selected message(s) into it with &#8617;.

You can also jump to a folder with &#8984;O instead of &#8617;. Awesome.
