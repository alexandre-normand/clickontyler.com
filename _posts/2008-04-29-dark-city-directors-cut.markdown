One of the best movies ever made just got [even better](http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/04/28/dark-city-directors-cut/).

> The original 1998 release ran 96 minutes and the new director's cut is about 15 minutes longer, clocking in at 111 minutes. The new cut supposedly has improved special effects and a new and improved sound mix . . . the new release also features two additional commentary tracks. &mdash;via [/Film](http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/04/28/dark-city-directors-cut/)

I can't recommend [_Dark City_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_City_%281998_film%29) highly enough. If you've never seen it, go rent the DVD. After you watch it, start over and see it again with Roger Ebert's commentary turned on.
