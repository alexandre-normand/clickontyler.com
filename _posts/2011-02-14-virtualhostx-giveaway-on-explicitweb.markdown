I'm very happy to announce that [VirtualHostX](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/) is sponsoring this week's episode of the [ExplicitWeb podcast](http://explicitweb.co.uk/). In addition to putting on a great show about [sensible social networking](http://explicitweb.co.uk/post/3291134670/season-2-episode-3-direct-link-sensible-social), the guys (and gal!) at ExplicitWeb are giving away a couple free licenses for VirtualHostX. If you want to win a copy, you'll need to listen to the show to find out how to enter.

You can listen directly on the [ExplicitWeb](http://explicitweb.co.uk/post/3291134670/season-2-episode-3-direct-link-sensible-social) site, [download an mp3](http://media.explicitweb.co.uk/seasons/2/ExplicitWeb_S02E03.mp3), or subscribe to the [podcast in iTunes](http://www.itunes.com/podcast?id=361101338).

Enjoy the show!
