Back in October I created my own URL shortening service called
[Foo9.net](http://foo9.net). There are lots of them out there already &mdash;
you can read [my reasons for building one myself](http://clickontyler.com/blog/2007/10/foo9-url-shortener/).
Unfortunately, shortly after opening it to the public I had to close down
because of spammers abusing the service.

I'm happy to say that Foo9 is back online now thanks to
[reCAPTCHA](http://recaptcha.net/). Hopefully this will keep the spammers at
bay for the time being.

Incidentally, I can't say enough good things about reCAPTCHA. It took me
fifteen minutes &mdash; from start to finish &mdash; to implement their
captcha on the website. That fifteen minutes included signing up for an
account, reading their docs, and adding it into my code. Awesome.
