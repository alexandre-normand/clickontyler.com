When I released the first version of Nottingham nearly a year ago, it was very much a stripped-down, immature product, but it got the job done. And the encouragement I received from you (my users) has been wonderful. I've sorted through hundreds of email and Twitter suggestions and narrowed them down to, what I think, is a kick-ass feature set for version 2.0. I don't want to tip my hand publicly just yet, but I'm happy to say that the new version is nearly finished and I'm to the point where I'm ready to begin soliciting feedback from some early testers.

If you're interested in kicking the tires, [send me an email](mailto:support@clickontyler.com?subject=Nottingham%20Beta). I've got space for about 40 more testers. Current Nottingham customers will be given priority, and everyone who participates will get a free license for 2.0 when it's released.
