Today, I'm happy to announce that [Incoming! 2.0](http://clickontyler.com/incoming/) is now available [on the Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/incoming!-2.0/id549327094?ls=1&mt=12). It's been three years since Incoming! was initially released, and I'm thrilled to finally get this major new release into the hands of users.

This new version of Incoming! is more like a Snow Leopard than a Lion. What I mean by that is the focus for this release has been on speed, stability, and laying the groundwork for future improvements. The achilles heel of Incoming! 1.0 was its inability to react to changes in Twitter's API (and all the other web services that it taps into). So the core of the app has been completely to rewritten to be more flexible. In fact, for many situations, Incoming! can now adapt to API changes without me having to issue an app update at all. That's a relief for both myself and everyone using Incoming! since it means less time spent waiting on Apple to approve updates.

If you've never used Incoming! before, I encourage you to [read my original post introducing the app](http://clickontyler.com/blog/2009/07/incoming-twitter-search-client-for-mac/). It'll give you a good overview of how the app works and what it can do. Or, if you're a long time user of the app, head over to the Mac App Store and [download the new version](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/incoming!-2.0/id549327094?ls=1&mt=12).
