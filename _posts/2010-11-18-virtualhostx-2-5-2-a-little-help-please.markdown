Because of a few changes in Mac OS X 10.6.5, I've had to make a few corresponding fixes in [VirtualHostX](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/) as well. Nothing major &mdash; just a few tweaks to suppress some Apache warnings that were popping up.

Normally I don't write a blog entry for a minor update like this, but this happens to be the first version of VirtualHostX that is a full 32/64bit Universal binary. This should have absolutely zero impact on you as a user, but just in case there's some obscure hardware configuration my testing might have missed (I'm looking at you PowerPC users) I'm only posting this update [here](http://amz.clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/virtualhostx_2.5.2.zip) for now &mdash; rather than going through the normal automatic update channel.

If you're the least bit adventurous, I'd appreciate you giving this new version a try and letting me know about any problems. Basically, the app will either launch or it won't. If it doesn't, please [let me know](http://clickontyler.com/contact/) along with what type of Mac and version of OS X you're running.

If all goes well I'll push the update out to everyone through the automatic update next week.

[Download VirtualHostX 2.5.2 here](http://amz.clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/virtualhostx_2.5.2.zip).

As always, thanks for supporting VHX!
