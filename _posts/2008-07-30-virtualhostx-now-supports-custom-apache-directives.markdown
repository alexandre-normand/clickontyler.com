The latest version of [VirtualHostX](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/) (1.1.0) now supports adding custom Apache directives to your virtual hosts. This was a feature I had been planning on releasing with version 2.0 but decided to add a simple implementation after so many users requested it.

As always, please send in your feedback and report any bugs you find. You can [email me directly](mailto:support@clickontyler.com) or use the built-in feedback option from the VirtualHostX menu.
