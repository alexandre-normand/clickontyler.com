I'm a few days late writing about this, but I couldn't let this week go by without mentioning that Monday 8/27 was a big day for me. Not only was it the fifth anniversary of [VirtualHostX](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/), but it also marked six months since I left my day job and began working on my own apps full-time.

When I first built VirtualHostX, I had no idea that it would be the first of many apps and lead to me running my own small business. In fact, my original goal was just to earn enough on the side so we could refinish the wood floors in our (then new) house. It's crazy looking back on that goal because, at the time, I considered even that a stretch. I had no idea it would lead to [Incoming!](http://clickontyler.com/incoming/), [Nottingham](http://clickontyler.com/nottingham/), [CommandQ](http://clickontyler.com/commandq/), a suite of mobile [traffic apps](http://clickontyler.com/tennessee-traffic/), and six trips to WWDC.

But it has.

And for that I have all of you, my users, to thank. You're the reason we were able to move across the country and be closer to family; the reason we could repair our house when our basement and all of [Nashville flooded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Tennessee_floods); the reason I'm able to sleep in each morning and spend the whole day hacking away on projects that interest me rather than what my employer dictates. Will I ever get the itch to get a "real" job and be a part of a larger team again? Probably. But until then, I'm having a blast working for myself and for all of you.

So, thank-you!
