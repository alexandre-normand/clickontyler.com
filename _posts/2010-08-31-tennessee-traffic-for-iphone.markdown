Last month, my wife and I got stuck in a [traffic jam](http://yfrog.com/n4udfwj) [so bad](http://yfrog.com/mem44hj) people were out of their cars and tossing footballs on the side of the road. I spent 15 minutes trying to navigate the [Tennessee Department of Transportation's website](http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/) on my iPhone, looking for information, but it was too difficult. They have a great site, but it simply doesn't work on a mobile device. I poked around in the App Store looking for traffic apps, but they were all crap offering little more than a few traffic cams on a map.

With some free time last week I thought I'd try and tackle the problem. The result is [Tennessee Traffic Advisor](http://clickontyler.com/tennessee-traffic/) &mdash; it's a traffic app for iPhone that doesn't suck. Using a simple, easy to navigate UI, it gives you the latest

 * Traffic accidents
 * Construction zones
 * Warning messages
 * Live traffic speeds
 * and every traffic cam in Tennessee

All this info is displayed on an easy-to-use map that automatically zooms in to your current location. Or, you can switch to the list view which gives you quick access to the traffic problems closest to you. With one tap, you can even skip ahead from accident to accident to make sure your drive home is clear.

I've already found the app incredibly useful a number of times &mdash; and my friends (biased as they may be) have, too. You can [download your copy](http://clickontyler.com/tennessee-traffic/itunes/) from the iTunes App Store.
