Look, I realize Twitter has to make money somehow. I'm fine with that. I'm also fine with [promoted tweets](http://blog.twitter.com/2010/04/hello-world.html) showing up in my timeline. But [promoted trends](http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20100611/exclusive-twitters-next-money-maker-promoted-trends/) rub me the wrong way. Twitter has always positioned the trending topics list as a sort of democratic vote amongst the community. We may not like the fact that [Justin Bieber](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=justin+bieber) is always there, but we can't argue with the fact that tweens are always tweeting about him. So when I see that a company has paid for a spot in the tending list - no matter how transparent Twitter may be about it - I don't like it.

So, I present to you, a humble Safari extension that simply hides any promoted trends it finds.
