Clever Google Maps mashup showing the [live location of ads being served on
AdMob's network](http://www.admob.com/s/home/live). Two points:

  1. There are lots of AdSense competitors vying for the mobile market.
[AdMob](http://www.admob.com/) is the first I've ever taken seriously.
  2. The developers at AdMob must actually like their job &mdash; no way this idea
came from middle management. Kudos to the recruiter who sent this to me.
