This week I'm in San Francisco knee-deep in Apple's developer conference. As exciting as it is learning about all the latest technology and finding new ways to use it in my apps, the best part of my day is getting emails like this one from a user. They remind me why I do what I do.

>> This is just a thank you.

>> I don't know why I like Nottingham so much. I've certainly tried a million notebook/notepad/to do apps.

>> I have a complex workflow and more and more I find myself turning to specialized applications &mdash; one for to do lists, one for an archive, one for concentrated research and writing, one for journaling &mdash; and then I'm now syncing these among a laptop, an iPhone and an iPad and among email and Dropbox and iDisk and . . . .

>> Somehow this simple application is invaluable for helping me to remember what's in process TODAY, to keep track of where I am right now in my progress on various tasks and to focus on what's important right now.

>> I love the integration with SimpleNote, which helps me to integrate the snippets of information I collect into their proper applications/locations for processing.

There are few things more rewarding than finding out that something you've built has had a positive impact on someone else. It's truly an honor.
