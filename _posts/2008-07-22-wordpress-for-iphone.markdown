While most of the applications in the App Store are rubbish, Automattic's new [WordPress client](http://iphone.wordpress.org/) is one of the best I've seen. In particular, notice how the post detail fields scroll up and out of the way when you edit the body text. Bonus points for using a British accent in the screencast.
