For seven years I ran the largest Stephen King site on the net. When I sold it
in 2005 I thought I put that world behind me for good. I had a [final article](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tylerhall/182881027/)
printed in __Lighthouse Magazine__ and moved on. But, like most things, it has a way of
creeping back into my life.

I had the good fortune of taking a class from [David Lavery](http://davidlavery.net/) at MTSU.
Last summer he invited me to contribute two short essays for his [new book](http://davidlavery.net/Books/Lost)
about the ABC television show _[Lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index?pn=index)_ and its connection
with Stephen King. I wrote one piece about his first novel __Carrie__ and another about __The Dark Tower__.

__Lost's Buried Treasures__ was published last month &mdash; available on
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Losts-Buried-Treasures-Lynnette-Porter/dp/1402210310)
&mdash; it's a great read for anyone gearing up for the start of season four.
