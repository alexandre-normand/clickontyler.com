I'm excited to announce that [Incoming!](http://clickontyler.com/incoming/) is now live in the new [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/incoming/id406765530?mt=12)!

Moving forward I plan on keeping the App Store version in sync with the one offered here on the website. For those of you who want to purchase directly from me &mdash; that's great! Or, if you'd prefer to buy from Apple so all of your apps and updates are in the same place, that's great, too. Each version has the same feature set and will receive the same updates &mdash; although the App Store version may be a week behind depending on Apple's approval schedule.

No matter where you purchase Incoming! from, know that you're always welcome to [contact me](http://clickontyler.com/contact/) directly with questions and suggestions.
