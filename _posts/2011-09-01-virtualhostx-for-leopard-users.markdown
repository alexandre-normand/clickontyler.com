As we get closer to the release of VirtualHostX 3.0, I just wanted to let any users still running Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) know that there is now a [dedicated page](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/leopard/) for them to download the latest version of VirtualHostX. For various and boring reasons I've had to create two versions of VirtualHostX 2.0. One for Snow Leopard and Lion users and another for Leopard users, which can be found [here](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/leopard/).

Sorry for any confusion this causes. Feel free to [get in touch](http://clickontyler.com/contact/) if you have any questions.
