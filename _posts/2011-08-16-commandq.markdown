Ever hit ?Q and accidentally quit an application when you really meant to press ?W and close a window? It's a good way to lose your work and feel stupid at the same time. Luckily, there's now an app for that!

Introducing [CommandQ](http://clickontyler.com/commandq/)!

CommandQ is a small app that sits in your menubar and catches your accidental ?Q's. It does this by showing an overlay with a timer that gives you a short period of time to let go before your app quits. Just keeping hold down ?Q if you're sure you really want to quit.

CommandQ is smart, too. You can tell it to work with every app on your Mac or just a few specific ones.
