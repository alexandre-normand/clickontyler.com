I'm in the process of moving this blog (and the whole site) over to <a href="http://chyrp.net/">Chryp</a> and off of <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> (which has served faithfully for two years). I plan on going into the details of why after the switch. But, in the mean time, I thought there may be other people looking to switch. I've posted a small PHP script to GitHub which imports your WordPress posts into Chyrp. Maybe it'll be useful to someone else.
