2009 is nearly over and I'm thankful to say it's been a great year. I'm lucky enough to have <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">a fantastic day job</a> that lets me run this little software business on the side. And, somehow, in twelve short months I've managed to release two new products -- <a href="http://clickontyler.com/incoming/">Incoming</a> and <a href="http://clickontyler.com/nottingham/">Nottingham</a>. Three if you count <a href="http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/">VirtualHostX 2.0</a>.

Each one has benefitted greatly from all the suggestions and comments (both good and bad) I've gotten from you, my users. For that, I say thank-you! And, as a small treat, I'd like to offer a half-off coupon.

Between now and the end of the year, send me a note with a suggestion for how to make one of my apps better and I'll send you in return a coupon for 50% off. It's that easy. You can <a href="mailto:support@clickontyler.com">email me</a> your suggestions or send it <a href="http://twitter.com/tylerhall">via Twitter</a>. Either way, it's a selfish way for me to get some great feedback and for you to get one last end of the year deal.
