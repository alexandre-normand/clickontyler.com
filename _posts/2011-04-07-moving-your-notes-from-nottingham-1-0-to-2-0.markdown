A few users have asked how to import your old Nottingham 1.0 notes into today's new release of version 2.0. It's quite simple &mdash; although it's my fault for not making it more obvious or, perhaps, automatic.

Open up Nottingham 1.0 and choose "Export Notes..." from the File menu. This will save all of your notes as text files into the folder you choose.

Then, drag those notes into the folder you're using for version 2.0. (If you don't know where that folder is, just choose "Reveal Folder in Finder" from the File menu.)

I hope that helps anyone who was confused as to where all their notes went.
