I updated [VirtualHostX](/virtualhostx/) to version 1.0.10 this morning. This corrects an error when using VHX with MAMP on OS X 10.5.2 Please [ping me](/contact/) if you run into any issues.

On a side note, VirtualHostX 2.0 is on track for a summer release. I'm planning on starting a closed beta test in time for WWDC in June. If you're interested in participating, please [let me know](/contact/).
