Just a quick note letting everyone know that both <a href="http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/">VirtualHostX 2.0</a> and <a href="http://incomingapp.com">Incoming!</a> are compatible with Snow Leopard. I've been testing them against 10.6 for most of the summer and all the issues I noticed have been fixed. That said, please <a href="http://clickontyler.com/contact/">email me</a> if you do run into any problems - fixing them will be my top priority.
