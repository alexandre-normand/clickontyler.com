Google has an [experimental search](http://www.google.com/experimental/) page
where you can test drive new search result layouts. My favorite is the
Keyboard Shortcuts option. This lets you navigate and view search results
using only the keyboard - no mouse required! It's a huge benefit for
[Quicksilver](http://blacktree.com/) fans.

Now that Yahoo! is my default search engine, I desperately didn't want to give
up the keyboard shortcuts feature. Thanks to [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and
[Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) I don't have to.

Make sure you're using Firefox and have the Greasemonkey plugin loaded. Then,
[click here to install](http://tylerhall.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/yahoo-keyboard-search/ysearchkeyboard.user.js).

I've chosen the same shortcut keys as Google. **J** and **K** move you up and
down through the search results. Press **return** to view the selected link.
You can even browse through multiple pages when you hit the end of the
results. Pressing **/** will jump you to the search box if you'd like to run a
new search. Hit **escape** to move back to the results.
