Last week, a reader emailed to ask why this website doesn't support IE6. Well, technically, it __does__ support IE6. I just serve it a plain stylesheet without any formatting. ([Go ahead. Try it](http://clickontyler.com/?ie=yes).) All the content on the site is still readable &mdash; it's just plain text on a white background.

Ok, I know that's a smart-ass answer. What they were really asking is why do I treat IE6 differently than other browsers? What gives me the confidence to ignore the browser with traditionally the largest market share? My browser stats:

  * 42% Firefox
  * 40% Safari
  * 7% Mobile Safari
  * 4% IE7 + IE8
  * 4% Other (Camino, Opera, WebKit, Flock, OmniWeb)
  * 2% IE6
  * 1% [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/)

I mean, seriously? Holy crap. I get more iPhone visitors than I do from Internet Explorer. Even a full 1% of my traffic comes from NetNewsWire.

That's why I no longer support IE6.
