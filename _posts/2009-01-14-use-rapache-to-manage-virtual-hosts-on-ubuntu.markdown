For people who like the idea of VirtualHostX but want to setup virtual hosts on Ubuntu rather than Mac OS X, [Stefano Forenza](http://www.stefanoforenza.com/) has created the [Rapache](http://www.stefanoforenza.com/me-and-rapache/) project. Like VHX, Rapache is a GUI to manage Apache virtual hosts. With just a few clicks you can create a new host and the appropriate DNS settings for local development.
