About a month ago (apparently late to the game) I discovered <a href="http://notational.net">Notational Velocity</a> -- a slick little notepad for Mac. I really liked the idea of it -- lightweight and totally keyboard navigable -- but the UI and implementation bugged me. So I did what any good Mac developer does -- I reinvented the wheel and wrote a clone I call Nottingham.

For right now it's a straight-up rip of Notational Velocity. To its developers I say thanks for the inspiration :-) In the coming weeks I'm hoping to add my own bit of flair to the app, including MobileMe syncing, <del datetime="2009-11-25T09:29:22+00:00"><strong>real</strong> Spotlight integration</del>, and (for iPhone users) syncing with <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a>.

If you're curious and would like to give Nottingham a try, <a href="http://clickontyler.com/nottingham/download/">download it here</a>.

As always, <a href="http://clickontyler.com/contact/">feedback is welcome</a>. I'd love to know what features other users would like to see added.
