Thanks to a tip from [Scott](http://sitening.com/about/scott/), VirtualHostX
is now working on Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. Your current copy of VHX should
download the new version automatically the next time it checks for updates, or
you can go ahead and [download it here](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/download/).
Thanks to everyone for your patience while I worked out the kinks with Leopard.

Now, any feature requests for version 2.0? [Send 'em in](mailto:support@clickontyler.com?subject=VHX%20Feature%20Request).
