		<p>In a nutshell, Highwire is a competitor to Apple's "Back to My Mac" service. You run one copy on your Mac at home, and another on your Mac at work (or at a coffee shop, etc). Highwire will then connect back to itself on your home computer and let you access all of its shared services.</p> 
		<p>Lost yet? What does this really mean?</p> 
		<p>Well, it means that when you're at work you'll be able to listen to your iTunes music stored on your Mac at home. Or browse your iPhoto library at home. Or do screen sharing. Or access any of your shared folders and files. It all works pretty seamlessly. You just open up Highwire on each Mac, and instantly they'll be able to share back and forth.</p>
