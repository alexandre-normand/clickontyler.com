In 1997 I created
[TheDarkTower.net](http://www.thedarktower.net) - a website which focused on a
series of seven books by Stephen King called _[The Dark Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(series))_. During the eight years I ran the site
it grew to become the largest Stephen King website on the internet. In August 2004, TheDarkTower.net was a [featured website on the Sci-Fi Channel](http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue381/site.html).
With nine-million visits each month and a mailing list of over fifteen
thousand members, TheDarkTower.net grew larger than I ever would have
imagined.

But it was more than just a website &mdash; TheDarkTower.net became my
playground &mdash; a showcase for the two sides of my personality. As a web
developer I managed my own server, did front-end design work, and wrote the
back-end code to solve new problems and challenges as the site grew. I created
a [full-text search engine](http://www.thedarktower.net/booksearch/) covering
all of Stephen King's novels. Users could search for a character, location, or
any phrase and TheDarkTower.net returned the book, page, and sentence that
contained their query. The Booksearch predated both
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/10197021/103-5911497-7426258)
and [Google's](http://books.google.com/) similar programs.

Even better, running this website gave me a place to share my own thoughts
about the world of Stephen King. In 2005 I published articles in _Gateway Magazine_
and _Lighthouse Magazine_. In the Fall of 2007 I was invited to contribute two short
essays in _[Lost's Buried Treasures](http://www.amazon.com/Buried-Treasures-Lynnette-Porter-Hillary/dp/1402210310)_ by [David Lavery](http://davidlavery.net) and Lynnette Porter. In 2009, I revised those essays and contributed a third to a new edition of the book.

In May 2005 I sold the website when Michaela Weiner (then president of [Grant Books](https://secure.grantbooks.com/))
made me an offer I couldn't refuse. After eight years, it was time to move on to new projects and new ideas.
