		<h2 class="title">How Does it Work?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Lift Off creates a secure connection between your Mac and the VirtualHostX Cloud then gives you a unique URL that you can pass around to your boss, client, or friend to view your site.</li>
			<li>Since your virtual host is being served live off of your Mac, there's no uploading files or waiting. Changes you make locally appear automatically for your users.</li>
			<li>It really is that simple. <a href="/virtualhostx/download/">Download VirtualHostX</a> and give it a try.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="col2">
		<h2 class="title">Technical Details?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>For the curious geeks in the audience, Lift Off establishes a reverse SSH tunnel from our proxy servers to the local Apache server on your Mac. We then assign you a random http://vhx.me short URL that dynamically routes your users through our servers back to your Mac.</li>
			<li>There's no reason a smart geek like you couldn't setup this sort of thing on your own, but we hope you'll like that we've already done the hard work to make it one-click simple :-)</li>
