			<h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
			<p>Lift Off creates a secure connection between your Mac and the VirtualHostX Cloud then gives you a unique URL that you can pass around to your boss, client, or friend to view your site.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Since your virtual host is being served live off of your Mac, there's no uploading files or waiting. Changes you make locally appear automatically for your users.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>It really is that simple. <a href="/virtualhostx/download/">Download VirtualHostX</a> and give it a try.</p>

		<div class='yui-u'>
			<h3>Technical Details?</h3>
			<p>For the curious geeks in the audience, Lift Off establishes a reverse SSH tunnel from our proxy servers to the local Apache server on your Mac. We then assign you a random <a href="#">http://vhx.me</a> short URL that dynamically routes your users through our servers back to your Mac.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>There's no reason a smart geek like you couldn't setup this sort of thing on your own, but we hope you'll like that we've already done the hard work to make it one-click simple :-)</p>
